# WDissector Library (C/C++ Wireshark Fuzzing API)

WDissector is a wireless fuzzing framework  for testing the wireless implementation of black-box devices that utilize Bluetooth Classic, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G radio access networks for wireless communication. The framework leverages the capabilities of Wireshark dissectors as a means of augmenting the fuzzing engine, and has the potential for extension to encompass other non-wireless protocols. It is important to note, however, that conducting fuzz testing on a wireless device requires the utilization of specific hardware, as outlined in the accompanying [documentation](https://asset-sutd.gitlab.io/software/wireless-deep-fuzzer).
